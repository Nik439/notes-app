This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

this will also initialize and populate the database, if you want to recreate it without having to restart the server just run:

```bash
node create_db
```
